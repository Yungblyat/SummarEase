Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity. Uh, actually, I'm planning to threaten you. You should have left your armor on for that. Yeah. It's been a bit of mileage and you've got the, uh, both stick and destiny. Would you like a drink? I'm stalling you won't change anything. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, noWhat have I to fear? The Avengers. That's what we call ourselves. Sort of like a team. Earth's mightiest heroes, time frame. Yes. I've met them. It takes us while to get any traction, I'll give you that one. But let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demigod. The super soldier, living legend, who kind of lives up to the legend.A man with breath-taking anger management issues, a couple of master assassins and you. Big fella, you've managed to piss us every single one of them. That was the plan. Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you. I have an army. We have a hulk. Oh, I thought the beast had won it off. You're missing the point. There's no throne. There is no version of this where you come out on top.Maybe your army comes, and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the air, if you can be damn well sure, we'll avenge it.
