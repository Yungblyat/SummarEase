SPEAKER_00: Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.
SPEAKER_01: Uh, actually, I'm planning to threaten you.
SPEAKER_00: You should have left your armor on for that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's been a bit of mileage and you've got the, uh, both stick and destiny.
SPEAKER_01: Would you like a drink?
SPEAKER_00: I'm stalling you won't change anything.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
SPEAKER_00: What have I to fear?
SPEAKER_01: The Avengers.
SPEAKER_01: That's what we call ourselves.
SPEAKER_01: Sort of like a team.
SPEAKER_01: Earth's mightiest heroes, time frame.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: I've met them.
SPEAKER_01: It takes us while to get any traction, I'll give you that one.
SPEAKER_01: But let's do a head count here.
SPEAKER_01: Your brother, the demigod.
SPEAKER_01: The super soldier, living legend, who kind of lives up to the legend.
SPEAKER_01: A man with breath-taking anger management issues, a couple of master assassins and you.
SPEAKER_01: Big fella, you've managed to piss us every single one of them.
SPEAKER_00: That was the plan.
SPEAKER_01: Not a great plan.
SPEAKER_01: When they come, and they will, they'll come for you.
SPEAKER_01: I have an army.
SPEAKER_01: We have a hulk.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I thought the beast had won it off.
SPEAKER_01: You're missing the point.
SPEAKER_01: There's no throne.
SPEAKER_01: There is no version of this where you come out on top.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe your army comes, and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you.
SPEAKER_01: Because if we can't protect the air, if you can be damn well sure, we'll avenge it.
